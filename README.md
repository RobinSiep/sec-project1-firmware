This project is being built using [NodeMCU firmware](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware). Below are a few useful link mostly for our own use for quick access and documentation.

## NodeMCU documentation
*Copied from the [NodeMCU Github repository documentation]
(https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/master/README.md)*

The entire [NodeMCU documentation](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io) is maintained right in this repository at [/docs](docs). The fact that the API documentation is mainted in the same repository as the code that *provides* the API ensures consistency between the two. With every commit the documentation is rebuilt by Read the Docs and thus transformed from terse Markdown into a nicely browsable HTML site at [https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io).
